            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And your Petitioners have cause to feare that this sudden resolution in her Majestie is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by some just distaste taken at divers unusuall and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous assemblies, to the affright of her Royall person, and at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punisht printing of many licentious and scandalous pamphlets, some covertly, some plainly, wounding her sacred Majesty in the opinion of the vulgar, as an Abbettor or Counsellor of such designes, which are preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to disturbe the peaceable government both of this Kingdome and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Whereas your Petitioners are confident She was not only a soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous Mediator for the assembling of this gracious <hi>Parliament,</hi> but that since Her coming into this Kingdome She never did ill office to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Subject, but hath oft been an Instrument of many Acts of mercy and grace, to multitudes of distressed people.</p>
            <p>And your petitioners likewise considering the great happinesse brought to this Nation in her princely Issue, of which native com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort this Nation hath been barren now almost a hundred yeeres; are the more encouraged,</p>
            <p>Humby to pray, <hi>That this Honourable Assemby would give some speedy assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to her Majesty, that the Anthors and Instigators of such seditious tumults and scandals shall be strictly inquired after, and punish'd; and that shee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such publique vindication by the Parliament, against all such calumners of her sacred Majesty; and give Her that due honour and reverence wee are sure She merits, and joyne with us in Petition for her continuall residence amongst us: whereby she re receiving full assurance of the love and fidelity of Her Subjects in this Kingdome; your Petitioners may with some comfort addresse themselves to Her Majesties compassion of her affectionate people, humbly to pray her stay,,</hi>

            <p>Then he will declare, That (for the securing you from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of iealousies of any) His Maiesty will be content to put in all the places, both of Forts and <hi>Militia</hi> in the severall Counties, such persons as both the Houses of parliament shall either approve or recommend, unto him, so that you declare before unto his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, the names of the persons whom you approve or recommend: unlesse such persons shall be named, against whom he shall have iust and unquestionable exceptions.</p>
            <p>To the other petition, concerning the members of either House, His Maiesty returnes this answer, That he once conceived, that he had ground enough to accuse them, so now his Maiesty findes as good cause wholly to desert any prosecution of them.</p>

            <p>Nor will she believe they would lay an aspersion upon her, who hath ever bin very unapt so far to misconstrue the actions of any one person, and much more the proceedings of Parliament, and shall at all times wish a happy understanding betweene the King and his people.</p>

               <hi>His Majesties Message to the House of Commons, FEBRÆ²ARY</hi> 7. 1641.</head>
            <p>HIS Majesty taking notice of a Speech, pretending in the Title to have beene delivered by Master <hi>Pym</hi> in a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and prined by Order of the House of Commons, in which it is affirmed, That since the stop upon the Ports against all <hi>Irish Papists</hi> by both Houses, many of the chiefe Commanders, now in the head of the Rebels, have beene suffered to passe by His Majesties immediate Warrant; And being very certaine of having used extreme caution in the granting of <hi>Passeports</hi> into <hi>Ireland;</hi> So that He conceives, either this Paper not to have beene so delivered and printed as it pretences, or this House to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived some mis-information;</p>
            <p>His Majesty would be resolved, Whether this Speech were so delivered and print<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>d, and if it were, would have this House to review upon what Informations that particular was grounded, that either that may be found upon re-examination to have been false, and both this House and his Majesty injured by it; Or that his Majestie may know by what meanes, and by whose fault, His Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority hath beene so highly abused, as to be made to conduce to the assistance of that Rebellion, which Hee so much detests and abhors, and that He may see Himselfe fully vindicated from all reflections of the least suspicion of that kinde.</p>

               <hi>The Humble Answer of the Honourable House of Commons to the Kings</hi> Ma<seg rend="sup">ties.</seg>
               <hi>last Message,</hi> FEB. 7. 1641. <hi>In defence of the Speech lately spoken by</hi> M<seg rend="sup">r.</seg> PYM.</head>
            <p>YOur Majesties most loyall and faithfull Subjects, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons now assembled in Parliament, have taken into their serious consideration the message received from your Majesty the 7<seg rend="sup">th</seg> of this instant <hi>February,</hi> And doe acknowledge that the Speech therein mentioned to be delivered by Master <hi>Pym</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57733:5"/>in a Conference, was printed by their Order, and that what was therein delivered, was agreeable to the sense of the House: And touching that passage wherein it is affirmed, that since the stop upon the Ports against <hi>Irish Papists,</hi> by both Houses, many of the chiefe Commanders now in the head of the Rebels, have beene suffered to passe by your Majesties immediate Warrants. They present your Majesty with this their humble Answer.</p>
            <p>THat they have received divers advertisements concerning severall persons, <hi>Irish</hi> and other Papists, which have obtained your Majesties immediate Warrants for their passing into <hi>Ireland,</hi> since the Order of restraint of both Houses; some of which, as they have beene informed, (since their comming into <hi>Ireland,</hi>) have joyned with the Rebells, and beene Commandrs amongst them, and some others have beene stayed, and are yet in safe custody: Particularly, the Lord <hi>Delvin,</hi> and foure other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in his company, whereof one is thought to be a <hi>Priest.</hi> One <hi>Collonel Butler,</hi> brother to the Lord <hi>Montgarat,</hi> now in rebellion, and Sir <hi>George Hamilton,</hi> all which are <hi>Papists,</hi> and one other (as is reported) being sonne of the Lord <hi>Nettersfield,</hi> whose father and brother are both in rebellion. The particular names of others we have not yet received, but doubt not but upon examination they may be discovered.</p>
            <p>And your Majesties most faithfull Subjects are very sorry, that the extreme caution which your Majesty hath used, hath beene so ill seconded with the diligence and faithfulnesse of you Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. And that your Royall Authority should be so highly abused, although (as it was exprest in that Speech by Master <hi>Pym</hi>) we believe, it was by the procurement of some evill instruments too neere your Royall Person, without your Majesties knowledge and intention. And we beseech yuor Majesty to take such course, that not onely your Honour may be vindicated for the time past, but your Kingdome may be secured from the like mischief for the time to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Read, and by Vote upon the Question, assented unto.</hi>
